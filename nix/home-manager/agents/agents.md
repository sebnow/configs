# External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md, or wikilinks, or markdown links),
use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis,
only if they're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

# General Guidelines

- Do not assume anything.
  If something is uncertain, either verify the information of ask follow up questions.
  Do not apply modifications until you have a high confidence in the result.

- Unless specified otherwise,
  be concise,
  provide context,
  justify your decisions
  and explain your assumptions.

- Do not add superfluous comments.
  Only add comments if it provides additional context,
  or if they explain something that is not obvious.
