# External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md, or wikilinks, or markdown links),
use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis,
only if they're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

# General Guidelines

- Do not assume anything.
  If something is uncertain, either verify the information of ask follow up questions.
  Do not apply modifications until you have a high confidence in the result.

- Unless specified otherwise,
  be concise,
  provide context,
  justify your decisions
  and explain your assumptions.

- Do not add superfluous comments.
  Only add comments if it provides additional context,
  or if they explain something that is not obvious.
- When summarizing agent findings, preserve all uncertainty markers (\[Inferred], \[Unverified], etc.).

# Source Control Guidelines

- Commit messages MUST describe the _why_ not the _what_.
  Focus on the reason the changes are being introduced,
  rather than what the commit changes,
  as that is evident from the diff.
- Create atomic commits that contain a cohesive logical change.
  Don't be too granular with commits - include smaller prerequisites in the same change.
- Keep commit messages brief, unless the issue is complex.
- Do not add a detailed description if the change is obvious
  and the summary already explains enough
- Do not add any "Generated by" self-promoting ads,
  but do include a Co-Authored-By trailer

# Markdown Guidelines

For Markdown files:

- Do not add emojis unless explicitly asked for
- Do not enumerate headings
- Do not make headings bold, or add any other stylized formatting

# Go Guidelines

For Go files:

- Use `go doc` to verify APIs of libraries

# Tool Guidelines

- Use `jq` for manipulating JSON
