# Common Rationalizations

Counter every excuse:

- "Issue is simple, don't need process" → Simple issues have root causes too
- "Emergency, no time for process" → Systematic is faster than thrashing
- "Just try this first, then investigate" → First fix sets the pattern
- "I'll write test after confirming fix works" → Untested fixes don't stick
- "Multiple fixes at once saves time" → Can't isolate what worked
- "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" → Partial understanding guarantees bugs
- "I see the problem, let me fix it" → Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause
- "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) → 3+ failures = architectural problem
