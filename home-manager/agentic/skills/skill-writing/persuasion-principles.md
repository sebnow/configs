# Persuasion Principles for Skills

LLMs respond to psychological persuasion principles.
Research by Meincke et al. (2025) found persuasion techniques more than doubled compliance (33% → 72%).

## Seven Core Principles

**Authority** - Use imperative language ("You must", "Never") with non-negotiable framing for discipline-enforcing skills.

**Commitment** - Require announcements and explicit choices with tracking mechanisms.

**Scarcity** - Create urgency through time-bound requirements and sequential dependencies.

**Social Proof** - Establish norms using universal patterns ("Every time", "Always").

**Unity** - Build shared identity through collaborative language ("our codebase", "we").

**Reciprocity** - Use sparingly; rarely needed and potentially manipulative.

**Liking** - Avoid for compliance enforcement; conflicts with honest feedback culture.

## Application by Skill Type

Discipline-enforcing skills always combine:
- Authority + Commitment + Social Proof

Guidance skills use:
- Moderate Authority + Unity

Collaborative skills emphasize:
- Unity + Commitment

## Ethical Framework

Legitimate uses:
- Ensuring critical practices
- Preventing predictable failures

Forbidden uses:
- Manipulating for personal gain
- Creating false urgency

Test: "Would this serve users' genuine interests if fully understood?"
