# Anti-Patterns in Skill Writing

Never:

- Write documentation without observing baseline failures
- Use vague names ("Helper", "Utils") instead of gerunds ("Processing PDFs")
- Use first person in descriptions (breaks discoverability)
- Nest file references deeply (prevents complete reads)
- Offer many options without clear defaults
- Include magic numbers without justification
- Use Windows-style paths (always use forward slashes)
- Defer to agents when scripts solve problems
- Include ALL CAPS (except acronyms) or emojis
- Write descriptions in first person
- Create deeply nested file hierarchies
