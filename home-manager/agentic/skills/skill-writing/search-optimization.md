# Search Optimization for Skills

Skills must be discoverable through keywords matching:

- Error messages users see
- Symptoms agents exhibit
- Tool names involved
- Task descriptions
- Common failure modes

Include these keywords in:
- Description field (most critical)
- Section headers
- First paragraph of each section

## Description Field Requirements

Start with "Use when..." for pattern matching.

Include concrete triggers:
- Error patterns ("test failures", "crashes")
- User phrases ("not working", "broken")
- Task types ("creating commits", "writing documentation")

Write in third person for consistent viewpoint.

## Keyword Density

Front-load important keywords in first 100 characters of description.
This maximizes match probability in Claude's skill scanning.

Avoid synonyms - use exact terms users/agents will search.
